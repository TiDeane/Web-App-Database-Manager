# Web App Database Manager

The third part of the IST Databases project, 2022/2023. It consisted of developing complex integrity constraints, designing advanced SQL queries, creating a web application prototype and designing OLAP queries.

#### The prototype web application, consisting of Python CGI scripts and HTML pages, allows you to:
- Register and remove products and suppliers;
- Change product prices and respective descriptions
- Register and remove customers
- Place orders
- Simulate payment for orders

A description of the application can be read under topic 4 in `E3-report.ipynb`
